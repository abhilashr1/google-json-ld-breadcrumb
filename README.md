# Google JSon-LD Breadcrumb Tool

Google recently started to recommend using json+ld script to document various attributes of a website, like the name, address, breadcrumb, etc.

This makes it easier to implement a hierarchy using breadcrumbs without taking the pain to implement a HTML/CSS and backend based visual implementation of breadcrumbs that goes>like>this in every page.

## How to use this

Just add the code anywhere in the body in a script tag or copy paste the code to anywhere in your js file. 

```     
<script src="json-ld-breadcrumb.js"></script>
```
